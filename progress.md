| August 28, 2024 | Nils showed his script; he could not produce v1 and v2 and suggested that Mitica data lacks phi_p dependency. Masoud created an issue and started a unit test. |
| September 10, 2024 | Masoud sent an email to Nils asking him to work on the integration script and requesting that he modify the script to accept the input file as a parameter. |
| September 11, 2024 | Masoud finished the unit test, proved that Mitica has phi_p dependency, pushed the commit, and closed the issue. |
| September 13, 2024 | Nils texted Masoud on WhatsApp stating he was sick but uploaded his script. Masoud responded with instructions to not merge the branch until the issue is resolved. |
| September 14, 2024 | Masoud reviewed Nils' script and sent detailed feedback in an email, pointing out issues with the reset of the integral, tolerance check, and incorrect handling of dN/dy. Andrea gave guidance on faster polarization calculation. |
